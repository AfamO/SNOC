# SNOC
This repo houses the standalone version of SNOS called SNOC. 
This is a standalone project . It basically monitors registered properties with sensors, detects whenever unauthorized intrusion is made to
them and reports to the appropriate person for immediate actions to be taken. It's a kind of mini IOT project.
